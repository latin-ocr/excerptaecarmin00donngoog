buhr's opinion that Catullus was a gigantis and extraordinary
genius, equal to the lyric poets ol Greeoe previous to the age
of Sophocles, is exaggerated (Lectures on Rom. Hist. ii. ,
p. 153), and as wide of the truth as Quintilian’s depreciation l
of him (Instit. Orat. x. 1, 56). The Roman critic lived in an ¹
age too late to relish the simplicity of the republican era. l

In the extracts which follow, l have endeavoured to select l
such passages from the poetry of Catullus as afford an insight
into his testes, pursuits, and habits of life,and1havepursued
a similar plan with the selectione from the verses of Tibullus,
Propertius, andOvid. The student will probably toke the more
interest in the verses, if they help him in some measure to a
knowledge of their authors. For the like reason l have pre-
fixed to each collection os extracts a slight biographical sketch
of the poet from whose writings they are taken.

The numerals in brackets, cy. iv (xxxi), refer to the number
of the poems in the complete editions of Catullus. The text
of Docring has been generally followed, with occasional cor-
rections by Orelli.
