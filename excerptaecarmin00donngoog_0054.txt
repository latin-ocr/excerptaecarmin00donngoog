ulau OF PROPERTIUS.

—-4·-·-

Saxrus Annuurus Pnoraarrus was a native of that part of
Umbria which borders on Etruria, but the exact date and place
of his birth are unknown. We know indeed that he was a few
years older thau Ovid, who was born in rac. 43. Propertius
may therefore have been born in ac. 51 or 50. He did not
belong to a family os distinction, yet his father owned consi-
derable lauded property, which however was much impaired by
au agrarian division—that, perhaps, which took place aiter the
war between Octavianus and Sextus Pompeius, in rac. 36. At
that time Propertius had not assumed the dress of manhood,
—topa virilia-ie. he was under sixteen years of age (comp.
Eleg. ii. 24, 37; iv. l, 129). In that year his father was dead;
he is conjectured to have been among the victims who pe-
rished iu the famine or on the capture of Perusia. From the
first elegy of his Fourth Book, it appears that Propertius was
destined for the law ; but, like Ovid, he abandoned it for lite-
rature, although the loss of a portion of his patrimonial estate
had nanowed his means of living—“In tenues cogeris ipse
Lares'’ (iv. l, 128). He did not, like so many of the Roman
literati of that period (cy. Horace), complete his education
at Atheus; yet his writiugs prove him to have beeu deeply
versed in Greek learning, of which indeed he is apt to make a
rather ostentatious display. He was also well read iu Romm
archaeology, as his Fourth, or, as itis sometimes reckoned, the
Fifth Book of Elegies, shows.

Propertius began to write verses at au early age; they at·
tracted the notice of Maecenas (Eleg. ii. l, 17), and he was
desircd by his patron to celebrate the military achievemeuts
of Octavianus. He had however been previously noticed by
L. Volcatius Tullus, oue of the consuls in rac. 33. Cynthia
was the principal mistress of Propertius, aud the chief object
