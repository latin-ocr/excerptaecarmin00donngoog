'qb-‘²‘ Eunalel. Vertumni-Vertumnus, we are told by Varro (ln L. V.
lb, p. 18 ε Miller), was s chief divinity with those Etruscaus who came
with Coelius Vibeuua to Rome. ‘hb iis dictus lhous Tuscus, et ideo ibi
Vertumnum stare quodie deus Etruriae princeps? The word Vertumnus,
says Dr. Donaldsou (Varronianus, cb. xii. §5), ‘⁴ has long beeu recognized
es a participial from uerte lt is usual to consider this Etruscan deity
as the god ci the suturnu, or of the ripe fruits3 but the co-existeuce of
the Asctumaus shows that this cannot be the correct view oi the matter.
hs the husband of Pomona, the summer-goddess, Vertumnus begcts
Carmelio, the darkeniug time o't' the year, and must therefore, iu himself,
be a personitication ot the spring, aer, which is actually included iu his
name For uer=ueut (lt-sape) is the period when the germs of the fruita
first come into being, aud this, as the beginning of new life,is a change
from the previous state of decay and nou-existence. We may say that
Vertumnus (orVertunnuss cf. Neptunus for Neptumuus) is the year when
‘it changes itaell: or puts ou a new dress ς und us the uara Fauoni, in the
lenguuge of Lucretius, is not only retemta, οι· released from its tormer
bondage in tue dungeone cf Winter, but also genitabilis, or the cause oi
birth, we may see that Vertumnus, the god of change, is also the repre·
sontatlse of the generetion or birth oi the fruita which lie fecundating
under the care oi Pomona, until they spring up into the huctumuus =
huctomenos‚ or growing year.'' Comp. id. sl. ch. 5, ξ 2.-Sipnu paterna.

5. Hoec me turbu juvat-‘This crowded and noisy street,' the Vicus
Tuscus, leading from the Velabrum to the Eorum Romanum. Apertion
of this street was called Thurarius, from the commodities sold in the
shops. Horace, Epist. i. 269: ‘Deierar in vicum tendentum thus et
odores! Mr. Paley, ad loq„ compares the title ‘street or quarter of the
Tuscans' with the Jewry, or Jews' quanter, in English cities.

ginally under water deep enough tor hosts, whence its name, from Vela.
