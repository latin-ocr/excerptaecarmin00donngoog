¹ Catullus chiefly describes the coverlet, stropula, of the nuptial conch, on
⁶ which is embrcidered the story of Theseus and Ariadne. The Palace of
Pharsalia is thus described:

‘Ipsius at sedes, quacunque opulenta recessit
Regia, fulgenti splendent auro, atque argento,
Gaudet ebur soliist collucent pocula mensis:
Tota domus gaudet regali splendida μοι)

Next follows a description of the nuptial conch and its coverlid.

Then follows the account of the story embrcidered ou the ⁴ vestis‚' which
was divided into two compartments. On the one wss depicted the deser·
tion of Ariadne by Theseus; on the other, the arrival of Bacchus and his
Maenads, by whom she is borne off to become the wife of the wine-god,

Ovid has treated the subject of Ariadne no less than four times ΑΙ) In
an Epistle addressed ιο her by Theseus (supra, p. tt) on the subject of
his abandoument of her (Heroid. a). ( ) ln the eighth book of the Meta·
morphosea ( 174-181), the story serves merely aa an introduction ιο the
transformation of Ariadne’s crown into astar. (3) In the third book of
the Fasti she deplores her twofold desertion by her mortal and immortal
lover (459-516). And (t) in the first book of the Ars Amasds' (527-
tot) Ovid emulates Catullus, and very nearly approaches him in excel-
lence, iu the description of the sudden contrast between the astonishment
and desolation of Ariadm, and the rout and revelry of bacchus and his
crew.

The reproaches which Ariadne addresses to the fugitive Theseus are
imitated by Virgil in the remonstrances of Dido ιο AEneas preparing for
night from Carthage (AEneid, iv. stt foll.); by Ariosto in the tenth canto
of the ‘ Orlando Turioso,' where Ohmpia, left on a desert island, ponrsforth
her complaints against Birenos aud, again, by Tasso (Gierus. Liberat.
canto xvi. 57-60), where Annida venta her wrath and scorn on Riualdo.
Catullus equals virgil and surpasses his other imitatura, ancient and mo-
dern, in his expression of the sentimenta proper to the circumstances. ln
one stroke of pathos, indeed, he excels them all, viz. in breaking off his
narrative without a hint of Ariadne's ready acceptante of a new lover.

The post thus leaves her iu full possession of the reader’s sympathy.
The legend of Ariadne appears under various forms. ln the most an·
cient of them Theseus did not appear, and she is merely the bgrossine of a
