parrot of his mistress Corinna. (2) Α poem by Statius (Silue, ii. 3), en·
titled, ‘Paittacus Melioris! (3) Lotichius. a celebrated writer of Latin,
who llourished in Germany about the middle of the serenteeuth century,
atttttttttttltttltttbullandum¹¹¹hm

‘Nunc, raptus rapido maloque fato,
lld manes abiit tenebricosos!

In grace and felicity of expression, however, the original far surpasses the
copies; and, indeed, if catullus has auy rivals in this poem, they must be
soaght in French rather than in Latin literature.

2. Quantum eat hominum vetustiorum (i. e. quotquot sunt homines
eleganter et delicati), all persons endowed with refined fedirga-sensi,
bility. Venustus, derired from Venus, the goddess of grace and beauty,·
has amoral aa well aa a physical import, and may be applied to mental as
well as corporal qualities, and to things and places as well as manns.
Catullus terma his friend Fabullus ‘venuste noster' (xiii. 6), and Cicero
(De Orat. it 56) says to Julius Caesar,‘ Quum omnium sis assuetissimus
at urbanissimus: ‘aman perfectly pleasant and polite? The beautiful
peninsula of Sirmio is described by Catullus (xxxi. 12) as ‘venusta' and
Cicero calls ready wit (facilitas jocandi), ‘sermo vetustus et urbanus ς’ on
the other hand, Catullus designates a piece of ill-timed pleasantry, as
‘res sordida et malama?

7. hasam (i. e. dominam, ‘suam ipsam ’), ‘his own mistress? Compare

Plautus (cain. act ir. sc. 2, v. 10), ‘Ego eo quo me ipsa (domina) vocat!

atros and αὕτη, in like manner, stand ior dominas, domino.

ll. haebreorum-compare Sallust (Catil. c. 52), ‘lnferorusn loca
sunt tetra, inculta, freda, atque formidolosar’ Hesind (Theogon. 744),
Naarda ἐρεμνῆς. . . olnladssudr and virgil (AEneid, vii. 268). AEneas and the
Sibyl at the entrance of the nether-realm (primis in faucibus Oroi):

‘Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram,
Quare per incertam lunam sub luce maligm
Est iter in silvis: ubi coelum condidit umbra
Jupiter et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem?

12. Iliun unde munst, em-Shakspearo (llamlet, act iii. sc. l)=

‘The undisoovered country, bom whose bourae
No traveller returns!
