OVID-

‘lris from the steep
Descende to search the silent House of Sleep.
'Naar the Cimmeriam, iu his dark abode,
Deep iu a aurern, dwells the drowsy god:
Whose gloomy mansion nor the rising sun,
Nor setting, visits, nor the lightsonre nonu: -
But lazy vapours round the region dy,
Perpetual twilight, and a doubtful sky:
No crowing cook does there his wings display,
Nor with his horny bill provoke the day:
Nor watchlul dogs, nor the more wakeful geese
Disturb with nightly uoise the sacred peace:
Nor beust ol nature, nor the tame, are nigh,
Nor trees with tempests rocked, nor human cryc
But sale repone, without an air of hreath
Dwells here, and a dumb quiet next to death.
‘An arm ol Lethe, with a gentle tlow
Ariaing upwards from the rock below,
The palace moats, and o'er the pebbles creeps
And with solt murmurs calls the gentle sleeps;
Around its entry nodding poppies grou,
And all cool simples that swect rest bestow.
Night from the plants their aleepy virtue drains,
And passing sheds iton the silent plains.
No door there was the unguarded house to keep,
On creaking hinges turned, to break his sleep.
‘But in the gloomy court was raised a hed,
Stuffed with black plumes, and on an ebon stcad.
Black was the covering too, where lay the god,
And slept supine, his limbs displayed ahroad.
About his head laniastis visione tly,
Which various images ol things supply,
And mock their lorms: the leaves on trees not more,
Nor boarded ears in fields, nor sands upon the shore!

Baucrs ar Parnasson. The imaginary reciter ol this story is Lelex,

‘Au old, experienced man.
Who thus with soher gravity begau’ (Drydeu),

in reply to the impious doubts of Pirithous, son ol Ixion, who had deuied
the power oi the gods to work miracles. Ovid is supposed to have bor·
rowed freely in this poem frorn the ⁴ Hecals' ol Callimachus, now lostr
for she, like Baucis, was a very old and very hospitable woman. See
Plutarch, Theseus, c. 14. After death Hecale was worshipped in Attica,
διὰ τὸ {sulcat Θησέα. The story ol ‘ Hyrieus' (Fast. v. 499) ia very similar
to that ol ⁸ Baucis aud Philemon!
