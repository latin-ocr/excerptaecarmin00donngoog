of his verse. Her real name was Hostia (Apuleius, Apolog.
p. 12: Bipont. ed), aud she was a native of Tibur (Tivoli).
Aa Propertius alludes to Cynthia'sf‘ doctus avus,” she may
have been a grand-daughter of that Hostius who wrote a
poem on the Histric War, ae. the war between Rome and Il·

lyricum, rac. 178 (see Livy, xli, Propert. Eleg. iii. 18). She ι
ι was a highly accomplished woman, who wrote verses and was ’
well skilled in music, dancing, needlework,-“castae Palladis ’

artes,”-and other female accomplishments. A Roman matron
was seldom so gifted as Cynthia; the probability is therefore
“ that she belonged to the numerous class of Hetaerae, a suppo·
sition strengthened by the facts that she had had at least one
lover before Propertius (Eleg. iii. 20), and that she forsook
him for a time, and took up with a stupid Praetor who had
come back from Illyricum withawell-liued purse. The younger
Pliny (Epist. vi. 153 ix. 22) mentions one Passienus Paulus

as lineally descended from Propertius. He may accordingly, ι
after Cynthia’s death, have formed a legitimate connection. ξ

The date of his own decenae is uncertain. Ovid mentions him
twice in his ‘Ars Amatoria’ (111333, 536); hut from these
passages the only sound inference is, that Propertius had then
(about ac. 15) oeased to write; it does not follow that he had
ceased to live.

Propertius had a house on the Esquiline Hill at Rome, near
the gardana of Maeceuas. He was on good terms with con·
temporary poeta and meu of letters, ep. with Ovid, Ponticus,
Bassus, aud Virgil, who seems to have read portione ,of his

belonged to the iuner circle of Maecenas’s protbpfa. It was the
ambition of Propertius to be accounted the Callimachus or the
Philetas of Rome (Eleg. iv. 1, 63), aud hence perhaps the eru-
dite character, and occasional difficulty in his writiugs. The
Alexandrian model clothed in verse the lore which he collected
in the library of the Ptolemies, aud the Roman imitator deals

largely also in carious mythology and archaeological allusions. Ι
The advanced scholar will find in Propertiusmuch to reward '

his studies. ln his Elegies indeed he displays less wit, fancy,
and riohness of language than Ovid, less tenderuess thau Ti-
bullus, and less original vigour than Catullus. Yet these se-
veral degrees of inferiority are counterbalanced by his nervous

style, the occasional beauty of his images, and the skill with
which he rendere his learning subserviant to poetry. At all
