NOTES ΟΝ

And weheful dopges before thern forre do lyc,

Wntohing to banish Care, their enimy,

Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.

By thern the sprite doth passe in quietly,

And unto Morpheus comes, whom drownbd doepe
ln dronsic fit he findesr of nothing he takes kepe.

‘And moreto lulle him in his elumber soft,
Atriclrling streame from high rocla tumbling downe
And ever-drizzling raine upon the loft,

Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sonno

Of swarming bees, did cast him in aswowne.

No other noyon, nor peoples’ troublous oryes‚

As still are wont t’annoy the walliid towne,

Might there be beard; bat careless Quiet lyes
Wrapt in eternal silence, farre from enimycs)

1. Cimmerion-The Cimmerii in Homer (Odyss. xi. 13 1011.) dwell
beyond the Oneon, ie. on the further side of the great river which enfolds
the earth. Some of Ovid’s description of their land of darkness and mist
is borrowed from the Odyssey:

’Ἔνθα δὲ Κιμμερίων ἀνδρῶν δῆμίς τε πόλις τε,

Ἠέρι καί νεφέλῃ κεκαλυμμένοι· οὐδέποτ’ αὐτοὺς
Ἠέλιος φαέθων ἐπιδέρκεται ἀκτίνεσσιν,

ott ὁπότ’ αν στείχῃσι τρδς οὐρανὸν ἀστεροέντα,
οίθ’ ὁταν ἂψ ἐπί γαῖαν ἆτ’ οὐρανόθεν προτράπηται.

The ‘Cimmerium domus’ is described by Valerius Flaccus, Argonaut. iii.
398. The Cimmeriam were an historicales well asnmythiorace. They

once were the chief occupante of the Teurio Chersonesus (Crimen). On ³

this peninsula was the Κύμη Κιμμερικὴ mentioned by Strabo (xi. 2, p.
102) ns the point from which vessels that entered the Sea of Azof laid
their course for the marhets nt the mouth of the Tanais. Herodotus

(iv. 12) mentions. as still remaining in his time, the tombs of Cimmerion ,
kings near the Tyras (Dniester)‚ and several places in the Scythian ³

country.

5. Dubio ἱιισίι.-· Light much lile e model-Ales. The coeli. Lucian
(Verae Histor. ii. 31, p. 29, ed. Biporit.) assigna the coclr (thember) a
temple in tbe city of Somnus: it is in the midst of a wood of poppy
and mandragora-trees (μηκῶνες ὑψηλαί καί μανδραγόραι), tenauted by
innumerable bats ίτολί τι πλῆθος νυκτερίδων).-δοίὶιίι“ίιόε canen. ‘Wake-

ful dopges’ in Spenser‚ Lo. Livy. v. 47: ⁴ Canes eollimtum nd nocturnos 2

strepitus animur-Anser. Though the dogs slept‚ the geese in the capitol
discerned the approach of the Gauls. Comp. Metamorph. viii. 684:
‘Unicus anser erat, minimae custodia villae! See Columella, R. R.
viii. 13.

12. Lethea—In sleep men forget their cares3 that river is accordingly
the stream appropriate to the llouse of Sleep. Virgil (Georg. i. 87) calls
Somnus Lefhoeus. ln the Hymos of Orpheus, 84, 8, Somnus is the

brother of Lethe. Callimachus (Del. 324) ascribes to Somnus a sleep· 5

drenohcd iring, ληθαῖον ττερίν.

15'. Soporem—The dew of olumber. Dryden's translation of ‘The
House of Sleep’ is excellent=
