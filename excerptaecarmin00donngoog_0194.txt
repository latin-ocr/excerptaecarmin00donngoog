her passion (comp. Virgil, AEueid ir. 2: ‘ vulnus alit venis ¹), and kindling
its damcs Ucres) afresh. Whence Tarpeis rushes forth like anymph of
Thrace, a Bacchaute, with torn rohes, (adesim stum) or an Amazon, roused
to battle. 'lbere is indeed some confusion in this simile, for the Thermo-
don was a river of Pontus, described by Pliny (N. H. vi. 3) as rising in
the Amazonion mountains; and, on the other band, there were no Arna-
zons in Thrace Propertius, however, is ιο fond of showing his reading,
that be sometimes makes strange jambles of what he bsd read.

76. Deliciis-Deinties, opposed to the ordinary sse of the country
people in their earthen platters, peccassemus-Immundas. Soiled with
smoke through which they had been leaping.

83. Forteque remim—‘⁸ And, because it was eholiday, ungusrded.”-
Occupat esse, (φθόνει παίουσα, Paley,) cuts the dogs' throats by way of pre·
cantion-Panis suis, the punishment which he meam to exam frons 'lar-

87. Portoe fldem, ie. sibi commissam. Her father, Tarpeius, was war·
den of the castle, and the keeping of the gete was entrusted to his daugh-
ten-Jasentess, in sleep. ‘Omnia praebebant somnos,’ v. 85.

91. lugeatis arma-According to Livy (i. ll), the temptation of 'l'arpeia
was not love, but avarice3 not a passion for Tatius, but a desire to possess
the hracclets and collars of gold of the Sabinos. She promised to betray
her charge if they would give her those bright things which they bad upon
their mins. So she opened a gete, and let in the Sabincs3 and they, as
they came in, by apsrdouable equivocation (⁴ neque enim sceleri dedit
hostis honorem'), cast upon her their brlgbt ahields, which they hore on
their arms, and crushed her to death. Niebuhr remarking upon the poeti·
cal character of the story, says (Rom. Hist i. p. 229, E. T.), ‘⁴ The Βοωοιι
poet conceived that the poor Sabines were covered with gold, as Fauriel
observes that the bards of modern Greece conceive of their Clepts. Here
the marks of popular poetry are so clear that none who bave eyes can
mistalre them. lt is in the very spirit that created all the splendour and
the measures in the house of Menelaus (Odyss. ir. 40). 'l'be fiction in
Propertius seems to be a mansfer, unwsrrsnted by any tradition, from
the story of Scylla of Megara” In Ovid (last. i. tto-sn) we have an-
other particular ot the legend. lanus takes to himself the credit ot raising
a barrier against the Ssbines by scalding them:

‘Oraque qua pollens ope sum, fonmna reclusi
Sumque repentinas ejaculatus aquas.

Ante temen calidis subjeci sulfure renis,
Clauderet ut Tatio fervidus humor iter!

94. lajastoe sortia-Spurius 'l'srpeius was slain by the Sabinas, though
he was innocent of his daughters treachery.

Enna. X. 'lhe following extract from Mr. Mesivsle's Hist. of mmo Ἠ)
will serve to explain many passages in this lilegy, which, as Berth ob-
serves, is an Epinician ode on the occasion of the fourth celebratior of the
Ludi Actiaci, or gemes established by Augustus iu memory of his victory
over Antoniam aad cleopatra at Actium, ac. 31. 'l'he date of the Elegy
