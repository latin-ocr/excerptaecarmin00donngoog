horribile cantu,’ the ear-piercing fise—Borboros is here Phrygian, like
the ‘aurum barbaricum,’ AEueid, ii. 504. Lucian describes the iustru-
menta used by the worshipers of the Syriao goddess (c. 12) in very
similar terma to those used by Catullus of the Maenads3 eg. t δὲ

VII. The Manlius to whom this elegy is addressed is the same person
for whom Catullus composed the beautiful epithalamium (LXI.) on the
occasion of the marriage of ¹ Manlius with Julia’ That he was a member
of the noble house of the Manlii Torquati there is no doubt, but nothing
more can be told of him. The intimacy of the poet with his friend or
patron is beautifully and clearly expressed. The elegy is an answer to a
letter oi Manlius desiring Catullus to console him in some sudden and
severe afflicticn, and the poet replies that although gratitude and affection
prompt him to comply with the nequest, he can respond to it imperfectly,
since he himself also is orerwhelmed with grief on account of the recent
death of his brother. Muretus considered this poem as among the most

for which Manlius required consolation.

2. morotum-Tne brief little letter. This word occurs in this passage
alone of Catullus, aud is among the many indicatione of his familiarity
with Greek. Probably he wrote ἐπιπόλιον, as we write rapianturque,
without attempting to naturalize it.
