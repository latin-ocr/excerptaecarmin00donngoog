‘Qualis Theseajecuit cedente carina
Languida desertis Gnosia litoribus?

Solaarena. The lonely saud-hesch—Immemor (ie. ⁴ promissorum,' uad. in
tbe promeae of the next verse), thoughtless. Theseus is generally de-
scribed as abandoning Ariadne more from haste to return ιο Athens thau
from perfidy. In sn Athenian legend the hero would naturally be repre-
sented in the most favourable light. ‘immemor’ occurs again infra a, and
there is an intimation of heedlessness in ‘caeca ruminel—Alpa adds an·
other circumstance to the sola crena: ‘arena' the sand; ‘alga’ the sea·
weed that grew on ἰι.-Μιίοιί. Ariadne was the daughter of Minos, king
of Creta-Sacer efficies. Ariadne garing upon the resscl of Theseus iu
the offing was a favourite subject with ancient sculptura-Prospicit, like
the preceding prospector, is ‘procul spectare-garing ou the horizon.

ll. Moysis . . .andia.-Comp. Oppian (Halieutic. v. 505): vobs δὲ olbtrr
κῦμα εἰλεῖται. This image is frequently employed by subsequent poets,
eq. hy Virgil (AEueid iv. 532), ‘magnoque irarum fluctuat aestu ι’ Silius
italicus(Punic. ix. 527) ς’ and Tasso (Gierus. Liberat) ‘ ln gran tempesto
di pensieri ondsggia! ·

12. Nonflaeoretinens.-Mr.Dunlop(Hiat.ofRom.Literature,i.p.465)
says: ‘⁴ Nerer, perhaps, was there a finer picture drawn of mental desola-
tion. She was incapabla of exhibiting violent signs of grief: she neither
bests her bosom, nor bnrsts into tears3 hut the diadem (mitram) which
had compressed ber looks-the light mantle which bad doated round her
form-the reil which had covered her bosom-all neglected and fallen at
berfeet, were the sport of the wares which washed the strand.’'—Flccc.
Auburn was accounted hy the Romans the most beautiful colour for the
human bair. The same epithetis applied presently ιο the hairof Theseus
—‘ flavo in hospite? Apuleius (Metamorph. ii. p. 30, Bipont. ed.) describes
auburn hair, ‘ut aurum coruscans in leuem mellis deprimitur umbram!
-Mitram The mitra, when an article of male attire, was a brazen belt
stuffed with wool or tow, lined with leather, and worn between the breest·
plste and the kilt or pettieoat of the soldier; when cf female dress, it was
a kerchief worn on the head, and made cf silk, linen, or coarser materials.
The ‘mitra’ is supposed to bare come originally from Phrygia, and ac·
cording to Servius (ed. AEneid, ix. 616) was synonymous with ‘calantica’
-Stropiiu ⁴ Strophium' was the sash or rihboa worn by unmarried women
immediately under the bosom. Non. llarcellin. (p. 538. 7) says: ‘Stro-
phium est fascia brevis, quae virginalem tumorem cohibet papillarum!
Sometimes it means a tillet worn on the head of priests. Strophium
(στρόφιον), an imperfectly naturalized word, did not retain its place in the
Latin language, and was supplanted bysoaeia, which is used iu exaetly the
same sense. Comp. Martini, Epigram. xiv. 1³4: ‘Fasciacrescentes dominre
compesce papillas.’

lli. Fluctus salta emebant-Cicero (Nat. Deor. ii. 39) employs nearly
the same words for a similar image: ‘Mare terram appetens litoribus
alludit! Vicems the circumstances cr condition of her garments, etc.

20. Ectmavit.—Drore beside herself, terrifled extremely. So below,
‘externata malo,' made wild by misery and missortune. ‘Externare' isa
word used by poeta only, and seldom even by them. Ovid employs it,
Metamorph. i. 641, xi. tr, 342. Itis a strengthened form of ‘ex-

terrere’
