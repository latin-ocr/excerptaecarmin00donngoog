Prom verse 70 to the end of this Elegy the poet excuses himself for aban-
doning his original scheme, which proved too laborious on trial, or too
uucongenial to his temper. He pretends that an astrologer werneri him
that the proposed historical poem would prove a tellure. The star-render,

industry, necessary ior the taslr. We may imagine the supposed prophet,
on learning the poet‘s intention to treet of ‘sacra diesque et cognomina
prisca locornm‚’ breaking out impatiently-
