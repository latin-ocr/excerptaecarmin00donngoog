dealing with passions of the higher mood. Of this drama
only two lines have been preserved, but we may judge of the
conception of his heroine by the grand soliloquy which he has
put into her mouth in the eleveuth book of the Metamor-
phoses (vv. 11-71). The poems which Ovid composcd in the
langna'ge of the Getae (Epist. e Ponto, iv. 13), or inhabitants
of Tomi and its environs, would, if extant, be an inestimahle
treasure to the philologer‚ since they would exhibit every
early form of the Teutonic dialects of Europe. Other produc·
tions of his fertile pen have also perished; but a poem on
Cosmetics (Medicamiaa Faciet), another on Fishing (Ha-
lieutica), and an address of condolence to Livia Augusta on
the death of her sou Drusus Nero, are incorrectly assigned to'
Ovi . ·
In the writings of his earlier aud happier years, Ovid dis-
plays all the qualities of a popular author. His fancy is

luxuriance of his fancy, he would have probably ranked even
with Lueretius and Virgil in the more elevated walks of his
art. As it is, he is the first of ancient elegiae poets, so far
at least as we have the means of compariscn. Nothing in
Mimnermus or Simonides, nothing in Tibullus or Propertius
¹possessos the variety, the eloquence, the imaginative opulence‚
or evenat times the pathos of Ovid. Ia pathetic couches,
indeed, Catullus alone equals or surpasses him.

Yet perhaps this censure is too indiscriminate. ln their col-
lected form they are read under great disadvantage. Originally
they were addressed to different persons, aud therefore repe-
tition of the same sorrow was allowable; whereas we hear the
complaint and all the echoes of it. The same fault may be
charged against many modern collectione of Letters. The
render grows tired of chper’s recurrence to the progress of
his ‘Homer,' of Southey’s reiteration of his literary projecta
