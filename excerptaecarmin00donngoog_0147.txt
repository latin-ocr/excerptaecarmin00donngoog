terta, or gowu of boyhood, was a very solemn onec it was performed inv
presence of the Lares, sometimes even in the Capitol (Valer. Maxim. v. 4.

'l'he usual season for it was at the Festival of Bacchus, in the mouth of
March (see Ovid, Fasti, iii. 771). Toga puro, Cicero ad Attio. v. 20,

20-26. omisero frater. . . deliciosissimi, v. 20-26.—The grace, ten.
derness, and beauty of these seven verses have attracted universal admira·
tion, and imitatione of them are frequent in modern Latin poeta. Lotichius,
for example (Ecl. i. v. 32), has transferred an entire line, chauging only a
single word, and the changeio not an improvement ; viz. ‘Omnia tecum
gna fugerant gaudia nostru ς’ and in Eleg. vi. 39, 40, has closely copied

Catullus always writes well, because hc felt deeply, on the subject of his
brother’s death. 'l'he poem entitled ‘Inferio ad Fratris Tumulum’ is
another beautiful and affectionate tribute to his memory.

29. Smptorsm non mopsuest copia—This and the three following lines
efford us some hint as to the mode in which Catullus composed poetry.
He cannot write so well as usual, he tells Manlius, because his hbreryis
at Rome, and only one case or box of books has followed him into the
country. When surrounded by his books, which we cannot doubt were
Greek, he studied the originale before he transferred their spirit into the
Latin tongue. Nor vas he singular in this practice. Horace, in like
manner, meditated on Alcaeus, and Virgil on the Iliad andtbe ‘Argonauta’
of apollonius of Rhodes, before they embadied their feelings iu lyric or
heroic messuras. Our own poet Gray always studied Spenser attentively
before he aut down to the work of composition, and Milton cnriched even
his opulent imagination by daily reading, or hearing read, some passage
of Homer, Ovid, or ‘the lofty grase tragediam! The true poet can
borrow rightfully, because he can also richly repny the loan.
