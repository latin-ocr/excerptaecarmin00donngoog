the western part oi his kingdom ol Pontus was annexed to it, and Cn. Pom·
peius divided it into eleven communes, or municipalities (Dion Cassius,
xxx. 8. tit-12: Strabo, p. 541). Hence it was sometimes styled in public

et Bithynites’ yet it was often called simply Bithynis (Tac. Annal. i. 74).
Pliny the younger was Proconsul oi Bithynia, am. 103-6, and from this
province wrote ιο Trajan his remarkable letter about the early Christiana
