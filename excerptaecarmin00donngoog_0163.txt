the coldness of its water, which property' rs caused by its carrying down
to the sea the meltcd snow of Mount Taurus. Alexander, bathing ιιι the
Cydnus when he vvav iu a great beat, was thrown into a dangerous fever
from the sbock of sudden cold. Quintus Curtius (De Exp. Alex. M. iii.
4) gives the following beautiful description of the Cydnus: ‘Cydnus non
spatio aquarum, sed liquore memorabilis: quippe leni tractu e fontibus
labens puro solo excipitur, nec torrentes incurrunt qui placide manantes
alveum turbent. ltaque incorruptus, itemque frigidissimus, qnippe multa
riparum amoeuitate inumbratur ubique fontibus suis similis iu mare evadit!
Its modern natue is Ter acer Iclty. With the mention of the Cydnus the
poet passes to the Lesser Asia and Egypt, and thence into a digression
about Osiris and his worship. 'lhe connecting link between tbe first
