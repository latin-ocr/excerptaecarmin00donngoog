μέγαν Πακτωλὸν εὔχρυσον.

38. Dirce—Orcus, or Pluto, is denominated rich because all the rich

A meu of the earth become his victims—Ignavae, sluggish, stagnant.

¹ Erue. XI. This elegy is addressed to some friends of Tibullus who
had gone to the baths of Etruria, while he was detained at home by a
fever.

1. Etrawca‘r fontibus unda-The batha and mineral springs of Etruria,
both hot and cold, were numerous and much frequented by the Romans. ,
Dionysius Halic. (i. 37) thus describes their medicinal virtues: Ἔχει
δὲ ἡ γῆ καὶ νάματα θερμῶν ὑδάτων ἐν πολλοῖς εὑρημένα χωρίοις λουτρὰ
παρασχεῖν ἥδιστα trel νόσους ἰάσασθαι χρονίους ἄριστα Comp. Strab. v.
p. 347. Among the more celebrated of these watering-places were the
nque Caretanm Clusina, oold springs (Horace, Epist. i. 15. 8), Pisanae3
Tauriana (Rutilius, ltiner. i. 250).

2. AEstioum Canem.-·-The Dog-star rises on the tanc of May, from
which period until the autumn the Etruscan baths were reputed unwhole-
some. Antonius Musa, the celebrated physician of Augustus, seems to
have considered Briae as unhealthy‚ and to have sent his patients to the
cold baths of Etruria (τὰ 'maevia strab. r. 3) in preference. About
the time when Tibullus was writing, Marcellus, the nephew and sou-in·
law of Augustus, died at Baiae (Dion, liii. 30), and the place became for a
time unpopular. Martial (Epig. iv. 57. 5) says that it was unendurahle
during the summer. ‘Maxima Baiarum’ is obscure, probably corrupt.
The construction seems tobes ‘unda maxima Baiarum vos detinet!—
Lympba'a steria Each stream and fountain had its tutelary deity-Lau-
dcndoe . . . Dece. The Bona Dea of the Romans, whose rites it was for-
bidden men to behold. The lst of May was her festival, and the anui-
versary of the dedication of her temple on the Aventine (ovid, Fast. v.
lte foll). She was worshipped by the Roman matrona in the house of
the Chief Pontiff, and it was accounted most sacrilegious in Clodius to
have intruded himself upon her mysteries (Plutarch, Caesar, c. 9).

12. Nec facta wanda, no secret crimes-Sollicitam. Sollicitum red-
dunt cor meum-Laecae. ⁶ changed the colour of,’ as winter changes the
colour of foliage. Ovid, iii. Art. Am. aba ι

⁴ Pallescunt frondes, quas nova laesit hyems!

Tibullus alleges a double plea against a sentence of death (¹ Persephone
nigram denuntiathoram,' r. 5): ⁶ l have been no murderer,ncr blasphemer
of the gods. . . . Neither am l so advanced in years as to render death’s
approach a natural erent. My hair is yet dark, my step firm. Iwas
horn iu such a year, u.c.43, when Hirtius and Pansa, the consuls, fell
before the walls of Mutina. Why pluclr the unripe grapa, or rob the tree
of its crude fruit with injurious hand? It will be time by-andby to
behold the Elysian Fields,¹ etc—Referam pueris. Comp. Eleg. i. 10. 44:

‘liceatque caput candescere canis
Temporis et prisci facta referre senem!
