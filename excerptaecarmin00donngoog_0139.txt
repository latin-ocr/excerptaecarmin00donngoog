¹ Hac omnia quam camis inops inhumataque turba ests
Nec ripae datur horrendas et rauca liuenta
Transportare priua quam sedibus oaaa quierunt.
Centum errant annos volitantque haec litora circnma
Tum demum admissi stagna exoptata revisunt!

98. Qoermm te percit—ln addition to the expansione oi this ides by
later poeta, mentioned in the Introduction to thia Epithalamium, compare
the following passage from Tibullus, Eleg. iii. 4. 35 foll.

‘Nam te nec vesti genuerunt aequore ponti,
Nec flammam volvens ore Chimaera iero3
Nec canis anguinea redimitus terga caterva,
Cui tres sunt linguae tergeminumque caput.
Scyllave virgineam canibus succincta figuram
Necte conceptam aava leaena tulit:
Barbara nec Scythiae tellus, horrendave Syrtia,' etc.

beream-comp. Theocritus, Idyll. xxiii. 19: κακᾶς ἅνάθρεμμα λεαίνας.

Οὐδὲ Θέτις μήτηρ· γλαυκὴ δέ σε τίκτε θάλασσα,
Πέτρα τ’ ἠλίβατοι, ὅτι τοι νοός ἐστὶν druria.

100. Syrtin. . ..Scylla . . charybde.-Syrata is a general namefor a de·
solete and aandy shore, from the Arabian sert, ‘a desert! Properly it be·
longa to tvro broad and shallow gulis, Syrtis Major and Minor, in the Libyan

eeaon the north coaetos Africa iba amaller Syrtis vvaa considered by ¹

ancient navigatore unapproachable, by reaaon of its aunlaen and ahelviug
rocla; and into the latter small craft alone ventured. The shores oi both
these gulia were nearly aa periloua since the sea, since they who landed on
them were, at mort seasona oi the year, liable to be buried by cloud-like

messes of send driven by the wind (see Pomponius Mela, i. 7, and ÷

Diodor. Siculus, xx. 41, and comp. Sallust, Jugurth 79). Either, how-
ever, the aea has become deeper off the Regio Syrtica, or modern sailora
are bolder or more akilful than the ancienta, ior the reporta of modern

travellers do not quite warrant the ill-repnte ol thia coast-Scylla, in ,

mythology, waa, according to Homer (Odyaa. xii. 73 and 235), a hideoua
monster, who barked lilre a dog, and had twelve feet, six long necka and
mouths. each of which contained three rowa ol aharp taath-hence sorae
in the text. In geography, it waa the name of a roclr aitnated between
Italy and Sicily. Her parentage is variously given by different poeta, but
the Homeric is the oldest known form of the legend. Virgil (AEneid, vi.
286) mentions several Scyllae in liedes-Clmrybdia, in mythology, was
the daughter of Poseidon and Gaia (i. e. offspring of aea and earth) who was

struck with thunder by Zeus ior stealing ouen from Heraclea (Servius ad ¹

AEneid. iii. 420). ln geography, it was the name of a rocla at a short
distance from Scylla The alternative of danger between these rocha ia
expreaaed in the proverbial line, at one time ascribed to Horace, but r
really occurring iu the ‘Alexandreia’ oi Philippus Gualterus, who wrote ¹
about lun. 1280:

¹ Incidit iu Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybdim?
101. Pro aaut atta-l. e. quam servatam a me accipit.
