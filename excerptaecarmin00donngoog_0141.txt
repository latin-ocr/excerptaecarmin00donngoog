Minos and Pasiphae, led the Cretan forces in the Trojan war, and greatly
distinguished himself in it. The story of his later lile resembles that of
the Hebrew J ephthah, at least in post-Homeric tradition. liaving vowed
to Poseidon that, is delivered fromn storm at sea, be would secdfice to
him whatever he should meet on first leading iu his kingdom, he was
coustrained by his vow to offer up his own son. For this offence Crete

were supposed ao visit with their seourge were disobedieuce to parents,
violationes social duties‚-e. y. respect to age, suppliants. aad guests,-
murder, and, as in Ariadne's case, perjury. In the Homeric poenas
