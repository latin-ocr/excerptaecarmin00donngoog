the old town ο1 Anemo, or Helicore, by Antigonus the Groui, who called
it after himself, Antigoneia. But a iew years later (1.1. 312-8) Lysinia-
chus, theo master oi Asia Minor, renamed it Nicaea, in honour of his wife
Nicaea,adaughterof Antipater. Strabo, who saw Nicaeaabouttwentyyears
aiter Catullus was there, describes it as a stately and handsome city, built,
like the other Macedonian capitale in usia, in the iorm oi a square, two
miles iu circumfereuce. All its streets intersected one another at right-
augles, aud from a monument in the centro all its four gates could he
seen. Nicea, in common with the Lesser Asia generally, suffered
severely irom the civil wars between Caesars death in nc. 48 and the
battle of Actium in nc. 31, and was partly in ruins at the time when the
younger Pliny was Proconsul of Bithynia (Plin. x. Epist. 4111, 48, 50).
After the seat of empire was transferred to Constantinople‚ the importante
of Nicaea increased; and there, in mn. 325, was held the celebrated
Cuuneil of Nicaea, which drew up the Niceue Crced. During the middle
ages it was a strong hulwark oi the Greek empire against the Turlrs, who
did not conquerit until the year 1078. The tiual destruction oi the city
was owing to the Turlrs employing its buildings as materiale sor their
mosques aud other edificem and although tbe ancient walls, with their
towers aud gates, are in tolerably good preservation, the modern Iouilc
contains scarcely more then one hundred houset?
