4. Harpocratem—Harpocraten was the last-born son of Osiris, and
was identified in his symbols and attributes with the Greek Apollo and
the Egyptian sun-god Horus. Something mysterious was associated with
his worship. He was represented with his finger laid on his lips, indica-
tive oi secrecy. See Ovid, Metamorph. ix. 692: ‘Quique premit vocem
digitoque silentio suadet! The worship oi Horas—Harpocrates-was
sometimes prohihiteo, but always rewsed after awhile at Rome. See
Catullus, lxxiv. t.

xl. There can be no doubt that the passion oi Catullus ior Lesbia, or
Hostia, was a genuine one, therein standing in strong conhast to the

aad he could not esteem her; yet she retained a hold on his affections,
and his verses betray the varying emotions oi a beart wrung by alternate

Xll. The Atys (attis or Atthis) of Catullus is not the Atys of mytho-

beloved by Cybele sud alain on her accounts the former is her thrall, the
vistim of his own trenay. lt is necessary to lreep this distinction in
mind, since, if the persons be consounded, the author oi the ‘Atys' may

be tared with inconsistencies oi which he is not guilty. For example,
why should Atys, if a native ol Phrygia, come oser the aeas-¹ super alta
vectus maria-to the Phrygian abode of the goddess? Why, ii he were her
lover or husband, is a lion sent to bar his escape from her temple? The
