Naxian story associated with the worship oi Dionysos. The import οἱ her
name, mactpteasiay, ἐρι-ἆνδάνω, is connected intimately with the joy oi
the wine-cup. Tho Atheniens, always anxious to enlarge the cycle of their
own mythology, coupled her with their native bero Theseus, and thus per-
haps she became the daughter ot an historioal personage, Minos, lring of
Crete, and master of the AEgean anditsislands. According to the Odyssey
(ri. 325) Artemis slew Ariadne immediately on her arrival at Naxos. ln
another legend it is said (Pherecydes ap. Sobol. Odyss. xi. 321) that
Theseus deserted her at the instigation of Athene, aud that Aphrodite
came and courted ber with the promise of Dionysos for her sponse. He-
siod (Theogon. 947) says nothing of Theseus, but merely that Dionysos ,
espoused, aud that Zeus conferrcd ou Ariadne immortal life.

Χρυσοκόμας δὲ Διόνυσος ξανθὴν Ἀριάδνην
Κούρην Μίνωος, θαλερὴν ποιήσατ’ ἄκοιτιν.
Τὴν δέ οἶ ἀθάνατον καὶ ἀγήρω θῆκε Κρονίων.

Dice-Dia was an'early name ot the island Naxos, one ol the Cyclades
groupe (Diodor. Sicul. iv. 61). lt bore several names in ancient writers,
e. y. Strongyle (Στρογγύλη), from its round form, it being about 19 miles
in length, and 15 broad in its widest part3 Dionysias (Διονυσίοις), from
its excellent wine, and its connection with the worship oi Dionysos ς and
the lesser Sicily (μικρὰ Σικελία), from the fertility ot its soil (Plin. Nat.
Hist. iv. 12, ξ 22). Dia wa atavourita appellatiou for Naxos with the poete,
e. y. Ovid (Metamorph. viii. 174)ε ‘Protinus AEgides, rapta Minoide,
Dian, . . . vela dedit: etc. Carians were among its earliest inhabitants,
from a chief of which nation it derived the name of Nasos. The island
was sacred to Bacchus. Statius (Thebaid. vii. 685) enumerares the places
sacred to the wine-god.

‘Meroida te fractis planxerunt Ismara thyrsis:
Te Tmolus, te Nysa ferax, Theseaque Naxos,
Et Thebana metu juratus iu orgia Ganges.'

2. Classe is here and infra put tor nane, as Theseus sailed to Creta
ina single ship—afterwards lrnowu as the Paralian galley, which long
afterwards sailed annually trom Athens to Delos, in memory oi Theseus,
atter his victory over the Minotsur, having pald his epiniciau vows in
that sacred island. Socrates remained in prison many days between his
condemnation and the draught ot bemlock, tor while the Paralian galley
was absent uo sentence of death could be executed in Athens, because, it
was said, the voyage to Delos commemorated the deliverauce of the youths
and maidens (electos juvenes simul et decus innuptarum), exacted
from Athens by, Minos. This gallsy was said to be the very same ship in
which Theseus had sailed, though it had been so often repaired as to give
occasion to acelebrated question among the Sophiste respecting its identity
(Plutarch, Theseus, c. 2³; Plato, Phaedon, c. 2).
