carcanus. 143

Atys of the poem is therefore properly the Attid novics, or Gallus, a
priest cf the great goddess. The mythological legend, in its triple form,
is recounted in Smith's Dictus Cr. and Rom. Biog. and Mytholcgy,
e. e. Itis partly astronomical, partly ethical, and, according tc the ern-
peror J ulian and the philosopher Porphyry, who each commented upon or
paraphrased it, typifies the course of the sun in the tropice, or the seve-
rance of the human soni from vice and error.

The name of the goddess is probably derived from the cymhals—
κύμβος, aduncae—used in her worship. ln works of art, Cybele (Cy-
belle, Cybebe) is represented as a grave and majestis metron, like Hera
or Demeter. Sometimes abeis veiled, and seated on a throne with lions
at her side; sometimes riding in a chariot drawn hy huns. Her head is
crowned with tovers, whence Milton terma “the towered Cybele, mother
of a hundred gods '' (Arcades, v. 21). Her right-hand hears a sceptre‚
and frequently a drum or tabor, Her worship, like that of Bacchus, wer
orgiastic, accompanied with lond mndc cf butes, cymbala, huma, etc,
songa and dancing. Her priests, named Galli, end Corybantes, rushed
about with hideous outcries, and cut themselves with knives like the
priests of Beal (l Kings, xviii. 28). The box-trec and the cypress were
sacred to her; stom the former were made her pipes, into the latter
was transformed her lover Atys. A description of the Galli and their
ceremonies may bo reed in Apuleius, Metamorph. viii. The principa] scats
cf the worship cf Cybele were Dindymum, a mountain near Cynicus, in
Mysia, whence the goddess is called Dindymene3 Berecyntus, in Pbrygia;
(Pliny, N. H. v. 29, mentions a ‘Berecyntius tractus' ehounding in bon-
wood, in Caria) end Sipylus in Lydia. The temples of Cybele were always
in elevated placesr several eerclites preserved in the templea of Arimis
Greece claimed to be original emblema of her sent down from heaven,
and there was a celebrated chryselephantine statue cf the ‘Mater Dindy-
mene’ at Proconnesus ; bnt the fece, instead of being formed of plates of
ivory, was made of the teeth of the hippopotamus (Pausan. viii. 46, § ).
loseph Wartcn, in bis ‘ Essay on Pcpe,’ makes the following remarks on
the Atys :—‘ The whole poem being ofa strain superior to the gene·
ralitycf Roman poetry, and being also so much above the tendes and
elegant genius cf Catullus, whose name it hears, inclines me tc think it a
translation from some Grecien renften and perhaps it will give the trnest
notiori cf en old dithyrambic of any poem antiquity bas left us! The
dithyramb nas sung by a baud of revellere tc a flute accompaniment. A

· full account of its origin end nature will be found in Donaldson’s New

Cratylns, ἕ 317, and ed.

The followin'g spirited version of a portion cf the Atys by Mr. Theodore
hlartin, printed among tha notes to his* recently published translation
of the Odes of Horace, conveys a competent idea of the vigour and bril-
liancy of the original, in which, ns Mr. Dunlcp says (Hiat. of Rom. Lit.
vol. i. p. 459), ‘Catullus is no longer the light, agreeable poet, who
counted the kisses of bis mistress, and called on the Cupide to lament hcr
sparrow. His ideas are full of lire, and bis langnage cf wildness: he
pours forth his thoughts with an energy, rapidity, and enthusiasm, se

' different frum his usual tone, aad indeed from that of all Latin poete!
