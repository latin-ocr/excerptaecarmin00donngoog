The poet Callimachus was 1 native of that city, and said to be of the
founder’s liin, being the son oi hattus and Mesatme; hence he is called
by Catullus and Ovid Battiades. Both Propertius and Catullus (see Lives)
admired aud imitated Callimachus.

IX. This poem reeords a risit of Catullus to the tomb oi his brother in

the Troad. Roman writers have left us many letters and 111111111 on
Consolation, and ancient historians heve told many striking tales of pa·
rental, fraternal, or rilial affection. Yet they rarely express domestic feel·
inge naturally. The former are fullos stately commonplacc, tha latter are
either normal or fancied examples. This and the preceding poems of Ca·
tullus are therefore the more valueble since their pathos is genuine, their
diction unaffectcd. Tbc following admirable version ο1 these lines, by
Mr. Theodoro himin, recently published in the Notes to his ‘Translatiou
of the Odes ot Horaoc‚' will be the best comment on them:

‘O'er many a 111, o’er many a strauger land,
l’ve come, my brother, to thy lonely tomb,
To pay the 1111 sad tribute to thy doom,
And by thy silent ashes weeping stand.
Vaiuly 1 call to thee. Who can command
Au answer forth iro· Orcus’ dreary gloom?
Ob, brother, brother, 1111 lost all its blooan
When thou wert snstohed from me with pitiless hand!
Α day will come, when we shall meet once morel
Meanwhile, these gifts, which to the honoured grave
01 those they loved in life, our sires ol yore
With pious barud and reverential gave,
Accept! gifts moistened with a brother’s 111111
And now, larewell, and rest thee from all f’earsl
