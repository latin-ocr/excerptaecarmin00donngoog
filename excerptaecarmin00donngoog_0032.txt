LIFH oh TIBULLUS.

-e—

Or the personal history of Albius Tibullus (his praenomen
is unknown) little has bean preserved. He was of Latin ori·
gin, of equestrian rank, and born about iao. 54, though some
of his editors believe him to have been five years older, and
place his birth in uc. 59. His paternal estate was at Pedum,
between Tibur and Praeneste, and, like that of Virgil and Pro·
Pettius, it was confiscated, in part at least, during ,the civil
wara ensuing on Caesar’s death. That he retained or recovered
a portion of it is clear from Horace (Epist. i. 4), who congra-
tulates Tibullus on his competent fortune, hundsome person,
his favour with the great, his sound health and literary repu-
tation.

The confiscation of his land was probably owing to the ne·
cessities of the government at the time, and not to any overt
act of the poet himself. Por Tibullus had a most un-Roman
aversion from both politius and war. Of the latter he speaks
always with abhorrenoe. In the former he seems to have taken
no part. Though contemporary with Virgil, and intimate with
Horace, Tibullus does not appear to have been notieed by either
Augustus or Maecenas. His principal patron was M. Valerius
Messala, who had fought against the Triumvirs at Philippi, but
who distinguished himself highly at Actium on the side of
Augustus. Tibullus however refused to accompany Messala
to this war, rac. 31. But in the autumn of the same year he
followed his patron to Aquitania, as contubernalis, or aide-de·
camp, and was present at the battle of Atax (Ande, in Langue-
doc), which quelled the rebellion. In the autumn of rac. 30,
Messala was despatched to the East, and Tibullus set out in
his traiu: but he fell sick on the voyage, and was left behind at
Corcyra (l Eleg. i. 3). On his recovery he returned to Rome.
The remainder of his days was spent iu peaceful retirement
and literary pursuits (Horace, lc). ‘
