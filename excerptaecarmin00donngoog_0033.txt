The mistress to whom Tibullus addresses the first ιιι elegies
of his first books rs Delia, whose real name is said to hare been
Plancia‚ Plania, or Plautia (Apuleius, Apolog p 12: Bipont.
ed..) Her condition ιι not very clearly made out, as sorne-
times she appears to have been an Hetaera, lilre the Cynthia of
Propertius, and at others a married woman. The se ond book
of his poeuis is chiefly dedicated to a lady who goes by the
poetic title of Nemesis Ovid (Amor. rii. 9) mentions both
Delia and Nemesis, and Horace (Carni. ι. 33) allodes to a third
name, of course a fictitious one, Glycera.

According to the Epigram of Domitius Marsus, Tibullus died
about the same nme as Vrrgrl ac nuc 19.

“Tc quoqu reVirgiiil reorur item non sequa, Tibulle,
Mors Juvenem campos misit ad Elysiosl'

Ovid, a boy when Tibullus was a mature man, thus notices
the difference of their respective ages (Trist' ιι. 5, 51)ι

“Virgilium vidi tautum= nac avara Tibullo
Tempus amici iit ue lata dedere merc.‘’

The first two of the four books of elegies that go under his
name are undoubtedly the work of Tibullus. Other and in-'
ferior hands contributed to the third and fourth books, al-
though he may have revised them and even added ιι few pas-
sages. The hexameter poem, ‘Ad Messnlcmss which opens
the fourth book, must have been written iu a rery ungenial
mood, if indeed it be a genuine productos his pen.

On the merits ot' Tibullus the opinions of critics, both an-
cient and modern, are much divided. Among the former Quiu-
tilian (Instit. Orat. x. l, §93) ussigns to him the first place
among Roman elegiac poets; ·buthc adds,‘ ‘Some prefer Pro-

i pertiusff' Dr. Arnold calls him simply‘ ‘abad poet,” and

Poins him ιιι badness with Propertius. Niebuhr (Lectores on

llboman History, vol.' ri. p. 164) )says that‘ ‘the doleful und

Amold or Niebuhr,' rs more just in his opinion of Tibullus
(Schol ιιι 'Propertium):‘ ‘Illum (ie. Tibullum) judicessim-
