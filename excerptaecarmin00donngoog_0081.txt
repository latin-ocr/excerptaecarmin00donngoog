his native Sulmo, a house on the Capitoline Hill at Rome
(Tristia i. El. 3), and a suburban gardcn of remarkable
heauty. At one period of his life he had leisure and means

to travel, and visited, iu company with his friend, AEmilius
Macer, Sicily and the Lesser Asia (Epist. ex Ponto, ii. 10).

He was thrice married; the third time happily. His last 1
wife was a member of the Fabian family. She bore Orid a
daughter, who was named Perilla, and inherited her father's η
literary talents.

, Ovid's life, until his fiftieth year, passed apparently in un-
broken prosperity. He was the most popular writer of the Ι
day; was admitted into the highest circles of Rome; and, cor·
rectly as it proved, looked forward to fame as enduring as that l
which he himself predicted for Lucretius But when his hair
was tinged with gray, misfortune fell upon him at once and ἶ
for ever. For some offence, whether persoual or political it is
now useless to inquire, Augustus banished him to Tomi (To-
mosaur), mn. 8, on the shores of the Euxine Sea. There, in ,
spite of incessant solicitations for recall, or at least permission ’
to end his days in a less inhospitable region, he died, after l
seven or eight years of various wretchednesS, shortly after the g
death of Augustus, ie. 15 or ld an.

The works of Ovid may be most properly divided into those ἢ
which he wrote before, and those which he wrote after, his ,
hanishment. In theone he displays the confidence, and sorne-
times the carelessness, of a public favourite3 in the other the
despair and imitation incident to afall from high estate. Το r
the former class belong his Epistolae Heroidum, or Imaginary
Letters to and from women of the heroic age of Graece. His
Amores, or books of elegies on topics, generally, of an erotio
character3 his Ars Amatoria and Remedium Amasim and his ,

learned poema the Metamorphoses, a History of remarkable

Transformations3 and the usti, or metrical History of the
Roman Calendar. The two last-mentioned works stand apart
from Orid's other writings, and will be briefly characterized
when we corneto the extracts from them respectively. Το the ,
latter class belong his five books of Tristia, and his four of . l
Epistolae ec Ponto, in which are contained the record of his
sorrows, of his ineffectual appeals to Augustus and the leading
men of the Augustan court, of his dimiuishing hopes and his
declining years. Besides these we hare a few detnched poems,
such as the elegy entitled Nus, in which a walnut·tree be·
