31. litiano, Ramnes, baara-rue three original tribes ef Rome. The
litienses, or Quirites, uere Sabinee3 the Ramnes, Oscan or Latin; the
Luceres, Pelasgum-Esne, ex primordiis tam parrin-Qappe. ln those
days so inconsiderable a place was Rome, eluat even Bovillae war the
larger city. Bovillae was ten miles distm from Rome3 yet, ss the hppian
and other reads were lined with houses, parles, tombs, etc, the suburbs of
the capital extended for many miles in all directions. ‘Suburban’ indeed,
seems a couventional adjunct to Bovillae. Ovid (Fast. iii. 667) also ern·
ploys it: ‘Orto suburbanis quedam fuit huna Bovius! ‘Suburbanus'
however, does not mean ⁸ close ιο e eity' in all cases, since Horace calls
his Sabineium ‘suburbana rura,’ and it wer nearly twenty-tire miles
from Rome-Ml petrium, nisi manen. ‘01 original Rome little or nothing
but the neme is left, but oi that name the wolf-nubs ere not ashamed.'
In the Soeial War, Pontius os Telesia, the Samnite commender, urged his
countrymen to destroy Rome, saying that it would never be well with
Italy until the wolves were burnt in their loir. hord Maesulsy, in the
‘Propheoy oi capys,' ξ 17, has finely expressed the pride ol the Romans

41. lom bees spondebant-Mn Paley observentur the shortening a
vowel before ri, ap, etc„ that, “ though avoided by the most polished Latin
poets, it lras a precedent in Homer’s use of Σκάμανδρος, ακεπαρνόν, etc.
'l'he andogy oi the hench ὅριοι (Lat. mino) makes it probable that in
such cases as ‘bene spondebant,' ¹ cape spinosi' (v. 4. 48), etc.,thesibilant
was dropped in pronunciation. So iu ‘ Consuluitque striges’ (ib. 5. 17),
and iu ‘smaragdos' (iii. 7. 44), where 'tripes (αριζειν, ‘to screech’)
and 'maragdoa were pronounced. Comp. σμύρνη with μύρρα, σμύραινα
with piperno, σμικρὸς with μικρός. The objection on the part of the best
Latin poets was, therefore, properly speaking, to the mutilated pronuncie-
tion, just es to the dropping of the final r with Ennius and Lueretius, as
