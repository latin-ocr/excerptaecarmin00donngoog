Ariadne from Naxos—Florem. AEtate, juventute. The Theben Bacchus
was represented by the Greek artists, and especially by Praxiteles, as
‘ever iair end ever γονης) Comp. Tibullus, Eleg. i. 4. 37:

‘Solis eterna est Bncoho Phoeboque juventas,
Nem decet intonsus crinis utrumque deum.'

‘Dionysus’ says Mr. Keightley (Mythology, p. 216, 2hd ed), ‘ wus repre-
sented in a variety of modes and characters! There was the ‘boarded’
Bacchus, calm, draped, end wise; the ‘horned' Bacchus, hali bestisi, half

lineaments of anaidem his whole air and gait ere effeminete; his long

195. Stiriate-The word Silenus is probably derived from inno, εἷλέω,
‘to roll,' expressive ol the motion of strenms. ln Latin silanus is a tube
or pipe ior convcying water. Lucretius, vi. 1263: ‘Corpora silanos ed
aquarum strate jacebant? Hence the connection between Bacchus end
Silenus, who wne said to be the son, or, according to Pindar (Fragm. 73),
the husband oi uwater-nymph (Nais): they were ull deities representing
moisture. Tbere were many Sileni; e. p. Marsyas is called e Silen by
Herodotus. Hence, in this passage, they ere spoken of in the plural, The
best-known ot them, the Silenus κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, wesen old, dni-nosed, bald-
heeded man, riding on e breed-becled ass,very drunh, bnt also very wise.
Hence Socrates, in Xenophon, symposium, v. ξ 7, compares himself to
Silenus, because he wns bald, flatnosed, wise, end, although no drunknrd,
