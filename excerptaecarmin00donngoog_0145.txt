‘'lhat Nyseian isle “
Girt with the river Triton, where old cham,
Whom Gentiles Ammon csll and Libyan Jove,

197. Lymphae-Lympha is nympha, water. ‘The dentals 'l' and
N are sometimes converted into [ι’ (Donsldson’s ‘Varronianus’ p. 255,
2ad ed). Lymphato· and lymphatici signify persons ‘mente eapti,’ enthusi-
amicissime, νυμφόληπτοι, 'caught by the nymphs. itis not impos.
sihle that certain effects-e. y. in cases of hydrophobia, calenture, etc.-
of water may have led to this secondary sense of lympha. Ovid (Meta-
morph. xi. 3) has·‘lymphats pastoral-Buechner, noisily showing.-
Capita deflectentes. Comp. Catullus, lxiii. 23, ‘Ubi capita Maensdes vi
jaciunt hederigerae!

199. Thyreae-The θύρσος was a light staff surrounded with ivy aud
vine-bmnches, and terminated in spine-eone. The more recent Greek
writers and some of the Latin poets supposed it to have been a'spear con-
cesled in icy, or having the point hiddeu by a cone; thus ‘tecta cuspide?
in the present passage3 and Seneca (Herculea Furens) says, ‘Tectam
virenti cuspidem thyrso gerens:’ on the other hand, Orid (Metamorph.
xi. 9) describes the thyrsus as poiutless:

‘Hastam-Quae foliis praesuta uotam siue minere fecit;'

aad Virgil (AEueid, vii. 390) terme the thymus ‘mollin’ Diodorus Siculus
(iii. c. 64) says that the followers of Bacchus carried spesrs covered with
ivy instead of thyrsi3 and Lucion describes the Bscchanals ss κιττῷ
ἔσστεμμέναι, νεβρίδας ἐνημμέναι, δόρατά τινα μικρὰ ἔχουσαι, ἀσίδηρα
κιττοποιητὰ καὶ ταῦτα (Bacchus, e. i. p. 292, Lehm.). (See Doaaldson,
New Cratylus‚ p. 505, 2nd ed.)

290. Pars e divulsa-Compare Euripid. ⁴ Bacchae,’ v. 736 foll, to whom
Catullus is iudebted in this passage- Obscura, hidden by vine-leaves, so
that no uuiuitiated person might discera the arpis, ie. sacred words or
symbolic actions-Onysia are sacred rites performed under the stimulant
of religious frenzy (cipri). The word ὄργια, arpis, signifies secret rites, or
worship practised hythe initiated alone, just like proripis„ lt is applied,
in the liomeric Hymn to Ceres, 274, 476, to the secret worship of Deme·
ter3 to that of the Cabeiri sud Demeter Achaia (Herodotus, ii. 51‚v. tl);
hut the word is usually confinedto the tumultuose ceremonies oi Bacchus.
hage, fremy, is a secondsry meaning oi ὀργὴ, whence ὄργια is probably
derived ; its first sense being an emotion of the mind (ὄρέγω), s teudency
to the sur-iace, an impulse. ὀργια may indeed come from ἔργον, as ἔρδειν
was used of performing sacred rites,⁴sacra hemel-Praeerat, hands
