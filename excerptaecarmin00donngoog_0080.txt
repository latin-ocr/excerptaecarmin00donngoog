Liuii OF OVID.

...q-..-

P. Ovinius ano was born on the auth of March, at Sulmo,
a town of the Peligni (Sulmone in the Abrurzi). The year ot'
his birth, rac. 43, was that in which the Consuls Hirtius
and Pansa were sluin in battle before Mutina (Modena), the

disobedient to the paternal wishes: he tried hard to master
the formularies of the law and the science of the jurists But
his toil was in vain: his poetical beut was not to be con·

and perhaps Ovid’s early success as a poet reconciled his
father to his disappointment.
