‘Attenuant vigiles corpus miserabile curaes
Adducitqnc cutem macies: et ιιι adra succus
Corporis omnis abit: vox tantum atque ossa supersunt s

95. croceam pro copore florens. -Tbe narcissus grows abundantly
about Mount Helicon, the scene ci Narcissus's transformation. The
Greek word' rs probably derived from the Persian Ns'ry ss. It was sacred
to Demeter and Korn (Sophocl. AEdip. Colon. 682).

Of this legend, so beautifully namsted by Ovid, there are other forms s

l. Among the lovers of Narcissus was a youth named Ameinies, who
slew himself st the door of Narcissus’s ιοιιιο, and called upon the gods
to avenge his death. Narcissus, tormented by sels· love snd by repent-
nnce, put sn end ιο ιιι life, and from bis blood there sprung up the flower
thet bears his neme.

2. Another account ststed that hebed a beloved twiu- sister, bis express
image, and that niter her death he gszed on his own features redected in
a well, ιο sctisfy his longing for the deceased.

3. Α third story wss thst he melted away into the well where hebed
beheld his own image. This was rstionalized into drowning himself
in the well (Enststhips sd Homer. p, 266). Many legends were in-
vented to account for the origin of flowers. Thus, from the blood of
Aiax Telamon there sprang up a purple flower which bore on its leaves
tbe letters at, st once the initials of his name and expressive ol a sigh.
The blood of Adonis became a rose3 the tears of Aphrodite lor his death
en anemone. Bion (Epitaph. Adonidos, 65).

Sosswr Domus. Spenser's description οι ‘ The House οι Sleep' is more
flnished then Ovid’s, but, as will be seen, is under some obligations ιο it:

Ἧι, making spesdy wsye through sperssd syre, Ἰ
And through the world οι weters wide end deepe,
To Morpheus’ house deth hastily repaire.
snm the boweis of the earth full steepe
And low, where dawning daye doth never peepe,
liis dwel'nng· rs. There 'l'ethys his wet bed
Doth ever wssb, end Cynthia still doth steepe
In silrer dews ιιι eser-drooping hed,
Whiles sad Nigbt orer him her manile bhclr deth spred.

‘Whooe double gates he findeth loched fast,
The one {syre lramed οι burnisht yvory,
The other all with silrer orercasts
