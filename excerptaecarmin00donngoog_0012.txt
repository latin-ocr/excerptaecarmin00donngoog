leu ΟΡ CATULLUS.

—4—

Vnnnnrus Curunnus was a native of Verona or of some place
iu its immediate neighbourhood. Itis doubtful whether his
praenomen were Caius (Apuleius, Apolog. vol. ii. p. 12: Bi·
pont. ed.) or Quintus (Pliny, H. N. xxxvii. 6). His father
was a person of some distinction, since he was the friend and
host of Caesar the Dictator (Sueten. Jul. C. 73). The poet
was born in uc. 87, and died in, or shortly after, uc. 47.
He went at an early age to Rome, probably for the purpose of

beautiful promontory of Sirmio, on the shores of the lale Be-
nacus (Eupo di Gurdo), he had a country house at Tibur (lt-
voli), a house or at least a artments at Rome, and was the
owner of a aoht, in which he made a voyage from Pontus to
Italy. (See loemat. iv., xxxi„ xxxv„ xliv„ lxviii.)

In the capital Catullus mingled with the gayest society, and
as a natural consequence, became deeply involved in debts. To
repair broken fortunes by plundering the provincials was then
the usual resource of Roman prodigals; and, for this purpose,
Catullus aocompuuied Caius Memmius, the friend of the con·
temporary poet Lucretius, to his praetorian province of Bithy-
nia. Either Memmius suffered no one but himself to rob the
Bithynicus, or the province had been exhausted by previous
exactione, and the poet returned to Rome “with a purse full
of cobwebs” (xz, xiii, xxviii„ xlvii), and exsecrating the ri-

the voyage, a brother, whom Catullus speaks of in his poems
with unaffected grief, is said to have died and to have been

huried in the Troad. Still poor, and still attached to egpensivc
