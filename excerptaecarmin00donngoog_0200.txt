‘Aspice ut insignis spoliis Marcellus opimis
Ingreditur, victorque viros supereminet omnes.
Hic rem Romanam, magno turbante tumultu,
Sistet, eques sternet Poenos, Gallumque rebellem,
Tertiaque aima patri suspendet capta Quirino'

-l'rajectoa l Rheno in Italiam—Vasti ducis. Viridomarus, or Brito-
martus, was king or general of the Gauls, aud was besieging Clastidium,
in liguria, when Marcellus won his armour iu a duel. He was a man ot
gigaatic size. Plutarch (Marcell. 6): ἀνὴρ μεγέθει τε σώματος ἔξοχος Pana·
τῶν, καὶ πανοπλίᾳ ἐν ἀργύρῳ sal χρυσῷ καὶ βαφαῖς καὶ πᾶσι ποικίλμασιν,
ὥσπρ ἀστραπὴ διαφέρων scandalon-Tectis rotie. The wheels of the war·
chariot were close together, and so were concealed by the body oi the car.

47. Vtryatc braccic.-Trousers striped with crosa bars, like the plaids
oi the modern Gaels ol scotland. Comp. Virgil, AEueid, viii. 659, who
thus describes the appearance os the Gaulss

‘Aurea cesaries ollis atque aurea vestis ι

Virgatis lucent sagulis: tum lactea colla

Auro innectuntur: duo quisque Alpina coruscant
Gaesa manu, scutis protecti corpora longis!

44. Tarpeia-The Celtic torpete derives its name from being made ot
twisted gold wire. ‚In their dress and on their mmosrr tlte Gauls were ·
luvish of gold. The torques and more solid cmwus of gold-preserved iu
the Museum os Triuity College, Dublin, apart from their worth to arch-
aeology, are oi immense metallis vulne. Unca is the clasp, or hook-and-
eye, of the torquis. The order suggested by Mr. Paley of this obscure
couplet is, ‘illi, nempe Claudio, torquis (unca) decidit ab gula incisaViri·
dumari, virgatis braccis induti, jaculantis ab agmine suo?

Ense. XII. This Elegy is an imaginary address from a deceased wife, ‘j
Cornelia, to her husband, AEmilius Puullus, who was Censor iu the year l
sno. 22. Cornelia was the daughter ot Scribonia, wife, at one time, ol
P. Coroebus Scipio, who subsequently married Augustus Caesar. She was
divorced by Caesar ou his marriage with Livia, on the pretext of incom-
patible temper. ‘Pertaessrs ut scribit' [Augustus] ‘morum perversita-
tem ejus.’ lt appears from v. 66, that Propertius composed this poem
in mc. 16, cousequently it is the latest of his extant writings. ‘It may
fairly be regarded? says Mr. Palcy, ‘as the musterpiece of the poet's ,
genius. Itis a splendid composition, rull of pathos and eloquent appeal,
and is, on the whole, worthy of the almost extravagaut praises which
editors of the poet have bestowed upon it.¹
c 1. Urqcre amuletum—⁴ Vex not my ghost.’-Manes. Comp. Horace,

armii. 9. 9:

‘Tu Semper urges debilibus modis
Mysten ademptum?

Ianua cipro, the door citha tomb.

3. Quum semel, . . ἔροιο-Δ When once the dead (firma) heve entered
upon the coaditions, become subject to the laws oi Hades, the pathe (oica)
to upper eir are closed with adamantius bars for even—Adamas is in
lutet writers only a diamond. Pliny, N. H. xxxvii. t, ξ 15 ;’ Martial, ι.
