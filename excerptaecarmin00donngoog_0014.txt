the Augustam poet, more properly belongs to Catullus. ln

some respecta also he, rather than Virgil, menits tha praise of
having refined ond dignified the Roman hexameter, since his “
poem entitled ‘The Marriage-Song ol Peleus and Thetis'

(lxiv.) is for vigour, majesty and sweetnesa nearly cn a level

with the smooth and atately measure of the Georgica and

AEneid. Tibullus and Ovid both assign to Catullus the epi·

thet of doctae, and its cause and propriety have given riae to

much discussion among commentators. If it were bestowed

upon him on account of his intimate acquaintance with Greek

literature, doctus would be equally pertinent to Propertius,

whose style was modelled on that of the Alexandrian versi-

fiers, and who aspired to be the “Boman Callimachus.’'

The extant works of Catullus consist in allos one hundred
and sixteen picces‘ol various kinds, and with scarcely any ar·

to that order of composition which the ancients termed Epi·
grams, tle. brief sententious pieces, with or without a satiri-
tal point, often simply commemorative of an incident or a
feeling.. of the ‘Atys' his master-work, we shall speak pre-
liminary to the extract from it. Itis probable that many os
the poems of Catullus have been lostt mere vera de eocitte,
such as he probably produced in considerable quantity, are
seldom earefully preserved, or worth preserving, after the oc-
casion which prompted them has passed away. We have not,
ior example, the ‘lthyphalliea’ mentioned by Terentianus
Maurus nor the ‘Philtra' or verses on love-cherma, alluded to
by Pliny (Nat. Hist. xxviii. 2). On the other hand, certain
Prema, like the ‘Ciris' and the ‘Pervigilinm Veneria,' are er«
ronecusly ascribed to him.

The lame of Catullus fiourished so long as Rome possessed
anational literature, and his verses, particularly his hendeca-
syllables, were imitated by the Italian poeta after the revival
ΟΥ elassical learning. Though much indebted to the Greeks,
he possessed a vital originality ol his own, which redeems his
venafrum the defecta ol servile copies. Greek in their forms

0f thought, and often in the turn ol their diction, they are trulv
Roman ins irie. ln grace, melody, and tenderness, he stands
